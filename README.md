#  CHOrganizer

This is a desktop application developed using Qt framework that organizes a song library for the popular rhythm game "Clone Hero." Many songs are uploaded by third parties and do not have any standard naming convention. This causes the library to get cluttered and disorganized. This program will organize the songs into  Artist\Album\Song\ structure.

I mainly developed this to gain some knowledge on the Qt framework, and so far have only tested it on Arch Linux with KDE.

Planned features:
- Edit song metadata
- Choose output path
- Move files instead of copy
- Export based on certain criteria (for example, exporting all songs with guitar and drums charts to a new directory)
